	With the calcualtions I have performed on these two data sources I can condlude two main points.The first of which 
is that Charter schools have a higher overall passing rate compared to Districts schools. Charter schools have a 93.62% passing rate
for math and a 96.59% passing rate for reading. Which leads to an overall passing rate of 90.43%. District schools on the other 
hand have a passing rate of 66.55% and 80.80% for math and reading respectively. Which leads to an overall passing rate of
63.67%

	Another point to note, is while it would make intuitive sense that the more funding per student would equate to higher 
passing rates. That is not the case. With the data provided. We can determine there is a negative relationship with funding per
student and passing rates. In our analysis, schools fell into 4 buckets for spending rates per student: $585, $585-630, $630-645,
and $645-680. These buckets had the respective overall passing rates: 90.37%, 81.42%, 62.86%, 53.53%.
